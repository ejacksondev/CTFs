3072 ports have been opened on localhost (127.0.0.1). Only one random port of these will return the correct flag - the rest will be incorrect. Can you find the correct flag?

**To run this CTF, run `./build.sh`. Don't forget to `chmod +x build.sh` first.**

_Note: for self-hosted CTF's the flags are hardcoded in the code and the correct flag will be obvious if you check the code._
