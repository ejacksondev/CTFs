I shimmer and shine, a winter's delight,	     	  	      	   
Born from the flakes that dance in the night.     	      	     	     
I'm sculpted in ice, a dome in the cold,    	       		  	      
Homes of the North, where stories are told. 		  	      	  
 	       	     	  	       	  	 	       	      	     
Children delight in my icy embrace,
With carrot noses and smiles on their face.
I'm a chilly treat on a summer's day,
Crushed ice and syrup in a colorful array.

In winter's grip, I'm crafted with care,
With blocks of snow piled high in the air.
What am I, you ponder, so frosty and grand?
I'm a riddle of winter, in this frozen land.
