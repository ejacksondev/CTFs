CTFs primarily built for use in NUHack Alpha. 

Each folder within the directory 'For-Hackathons' contains the source code to build the challenges. You will have to inject unique flag values using a global variable called $FLAG each time a challenge is built. 

Each folder within the directory 'Self-Hosted' is intended to be for use if you'd like to try the challenges outside of a hackathon! To run these, use the build.sh scripts contained within each challenge. Python3 is required for these. If in doubt, the README.md should point you the correct way. Answers available in the Answers directory.

*Please note that each folder within the 'For-Hackathons' directory may contain spoilers or answers!*

### URL-Challenge
A basic warmup...

### Frosty
Solve the riddle to find the flag.

### International
Prove that you are a truly international player! You must visit your reference URL from at least 10 different countries within 15 seconds to win this flag!

### Evil-Ports
3072 ports have been opened on localhost (127.0.0.1). Only one random port of these will return the correct flag - the rest will be incorrect. Can you find the correct flag?

### IRC-Challenge
In progress...check back later!
